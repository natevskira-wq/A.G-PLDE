PLDE: Procedural Language Drill Engine
"Language is a physical reflex, not an intellectual puzzle."
PLDE is a high-intensity language training platform designed to build automaticity through procedural drills. It rejects gamification in favor of speed, strictness, and muscle memory.
Current Version: v5.1 (Director Mode & Smart Voice)
Architect: Abd-Alrahman Gamal (A.G)
🏗️ Architecture
Frontend: Vanilla HTML/JS (Single File Architecture). No frameworks, no build steps.
Backend: Supabase (Database + Authentication + Storage).
Voice Engine: Hybrid System (Web Speech API + Custom Jamo/Phonetic Matchers).
Philosophy: Brutalist Design. Mobile-First. Offline-Capable Logic.
🚀 Setup & Deployment
1. Prerequisites
You need a free Supabase project.
Create a project at supabase.com.
Go to Project Settings -> API and copy your URL and ANON KEY.
2. Database Schema
Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor to set up the tables:
code
SQL
-- Smart Code User System
create table user_profiles (
  access_code text primary key,
  device_1 text,
  device_2 text,
  progress jsonb default '{}'::jsonb,
  created_at timestamptz default now()
);
alter table user_profiles enable row level security;
create policy "Public Access" on user_profiles for all using (true) with check (true);

-- Lesson Content System
create table lessons (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  created_at timestamptz default now(),
  title text not null,
  content jsonb not null,
  sequence int default 999
);
alter table lessons enable row level security;
create policy "Public Read" on lessons for select using (true);
create policy "Public Write" on lessons for insert with check (true);
create policy "Public Update" on lessons for update using (true);
3. Storage Setup
Go to Storage in Supabase.
Create a new bucket named media.
Set it to Public.
4. Configuration
Open index.html and admin.html. Find the configuration block at the top and replace with your keys:
code
JavaScript
const SUPABASE_URL = 'YOUR_SUPABASE_URL';
const SUPABASE_KEY = 'YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY';
5. Deployment
Simply upload index.html and admin.html to GitHub Pages (or any static host).
User Site: yourname.github.io/plde/
Admin Panel: yourname.github.io/plde/admin.html
