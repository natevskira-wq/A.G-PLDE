PLDE: Procedural Language Drill Engine (v11)

"Language is a physical reflex, not an intellectual puzzle."

PLDE is an enterprise-grade drill engine designed for high-intensity language training. It supports multi-user management, creator licensing, and advanced audio-first workflows.

Architect: Abd-Alrahman Gamal (A.G)
Current Version: v11 (SaaS Ready)

🏗️ Architecture

Frontend: Vanilla HTML/JS (Single File Architecture).

Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage).

Voice Engine: Hybrid System (Web Speech API + Universal Korean Matcher).

Logic: Spaced Repetition (SRS), Decay Locking, and Modular Drill Loops.

🚀 Setup & Deployment
1. Database Schema (SQL)

Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor to set up the full v11 infrastructure:

code
SQL
download
content_copy
expand_less
-- 1. USER PROFILES (Smart Code System)
create table user_profiles (
  access_code text primary key,
  role text default 'user', -- 'admin', 'creator', 'user'
  licenses jsonb default '[]'::jsonb, -- e.g. ["de-en-A1"]
  device_1 text,
  device_2 text,
  progress jsonb default '{}'::jsonb,
  created_at timestamptz default now()
);
alter table user_profiles enable row level security;
create policy "Public Access" on user_profiles for all using (true) with check (true);

-- 2. LESSON CONTENT
create table lessons (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  created_at timestamptz default now(),
  title text not null,
  content jsonb not null,
  sequence int default 999,
  owner_code text -- If NULL, Public. If Set, Private.
);
alter table lessons enable row level security;
create policy "Public Read" on lessons for select using (true);
create policy "Public Write" on lessons for insert with check (true);
create policy "Public Update" on lessons for update using (true);
create policy "Public Delete" on lessons for delete using (true);
2. Storage

Create a public bucket named media.

3. Deployment

Upload index.html, admin.html, and manager.html to your host (GitHub Pages).

🎮 The Ecosystem
1. The Drill Engine (index.html)

Smart Code Login: 2-Device Lock. Auto-sync.

Director Mode: Supports "Audio Only" drills, "Test Mode" (Blind Imprint), and "Modular Loops" (Skip specific phases).

Decay Lock: Enforces maintenance. If a lesson decays (>3 days), new content locks.

2. The Creator Studio (admin.html)

Director Console: Toggle Text/Translation visibility, set Voice Strictness (0.1-1.0), and configure Auto-Play.

Private/Public: Creators can publish lessons visible only to themselves or to everyone.

AI Station: Paste prompts to auto-generate complex JSON structures.

3. The God Mode (manager.html)

User Management: Issue Access Codes in batches.

Licensing: Grant specific permissions (e.g., "Can teach German A1").

Device Reset: Clear stuck device locks for users.

🧠 Advanced Logic

Universal Korean Matcher: Decomposes Hangul into Jamo to allow fuzzy matching for voice input.

Audio Matcher: A safety fallback for short words. Instead of speaking, the user identifies the correct sound from 3 options.

SRS Algorithm: Lesson review intervals expand exponentially (1 -> 3 -> 7 -> 14 -> 30 days) based on performance.
